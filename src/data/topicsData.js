            `Contemporary Lithuanian diplomacy developed from the political aims nurtured by its people in the early 20th century. The idea of Independence was implemented during World War I when the founders of the state entered the domain of diplomacy as well: they corresponded with the governments of other nations, participated in negotiations and meetings with representatives from foreign countries.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Lithuania was founded on the 7th of November 1918, and subsequently, soon Lithuanian legations and consulates were established in the majority of European capitals internationally. In the interwar period, Lithuanian diplomats were active in various diplomatic spheres: signing treaties with foreign countries, concluding trade agreements, as well as supporting compatriots abroad. The Diplomatic Service of Lithuania helped ensure the continuation of the Republic of Lithuania's independence and contributed to the restoration of Lithuanian independence.
In the present day, the Diplomatic Service of Lithuania unites strong-minded, inquiring, vigorous, and educated people, contributing to the international stability and security as well as the welfare of its State and people.
The exhibition presents the heritage of the diplomatic service of Lithuania and its present activities within the very building where the interviewing governments sought the services of the country.`,

            `The Ministry of Foreign Affairs was founded in late 1918 in Vilnius. It was not there for long, though. When Poland occupied Vilnius and Vilnius region, the Government of Lithuania and all Ministries moved to Kaunas. Meanwhile, Kaunas became the temporary as well as the diplomatic capital of the country for more than 20 years, as long as the Vilnius Dispute, one of the most complex interwar territorial disputes in Europe, has continued. There were the most important decisions made and foreign diplomatic missions established in Kaunas.
 The first Lithuanian diplomats lacked skills and knowledge. They, however, persevered their goals, firmly believing their work to be meaningful. After several years of their hard work, they were already able to enjoy the results: international recognition, membership of the Republic of Lithuania in the League of Nations, and, most importantly, recognition of the Klaipeda district as an autonomous part of the Lithuanian state by the international agreement. Signatories of the Independence Declaration, graduates, and even foreign students all worked together in the Diplomatic Service of the Republic of Lithuania. Through their efforts, the name of Lithuania became more and more often mentioned in capitals of Europe and around the world. Less than a decade after the Restoration of the Independent State, Lithuania could be proud of having a small but professional Diplomatic Service defending the interests of the state at the international level.
Lithuanian diplomats could not protect their country from malicious aggressors; however, their patriotism and selfless work for Lithuania remained during the years of harsh exile during foreign occupations, which Lithuania suffered from three times.`,

            `The changes of the international situation in the early 1930s required ammending the foreign policy of Lithuania. A new direction was proposed by Stasys Lozoraitis, who became the Minister of Foreign Affairs on the 12th of June, 1934. At the age of 36, Stasys Lozoraitis had been one of the youngest Ministers of Foreign Affairs in Europe!
Facing the risks emerging from Germany and the one-sided dependence of Lithuania on the USSR in regards to the issue of Vilnius, Stasys Lozoraitis proposed the course of closer relations with Great Britain and France. Keeping in mind that Lithuania had no chance to fight on two fronts, the Minister of Foreign Affairs proposed the following logic to solve the major two problems of Lithuania’s foreign policy: “We have Klaipeda, but it is in great danger; we don’t have Vilnius and can’t expect its recovery in the nearest future. Therefore we have to defend Klaipeda by all means.”
Stasys Lozoraitis aimed at making the foreign policy of Lithuania less dependent on Berlin and Moscow by signing the Baltic Treaty on Concord and Cooperation (September 12, 1934). However, his suggestion that “independence is more important than Vilnius” was not approved in full by President Antanas Smetona and Prime Minister J. Tūbelis.
When Poland refused Stasys Lozoraitis’ initiatives aimed at normalization of bilateral relations and delivered an ultimatum to Lithuania (March 17, 1938), the New Course policy failed. On the 6th of December 1938, the Government of Lithuania appointed Juozas Urbšys the Minister of Foreign Affairs in order to avoid complicating relations with Germany. Stasys Lozoraitis was appointed as a Lithuanian envoy to Rome.
The exhibition is dedicated to the memory of the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Lithuania Stasys Lozoraitis.`,

            `The destiny of people, as well as of some states has been changed by World War II. Those who re-established the State of Lithuania in 1918 had to see its destruction and face Soviet repressions in the summer of 1940. The Soviet occupation divided the Lithuanian nation into two parts: the one enduring murder and repressions in occupied Lithuania, and the other part of the nation, in exile, incessantly manifesting the will for freedom. Due to the activity of the Diplomatic Service of Lithuania, legally the independence of Lithuania has not been interrupted. In 1940–1990, only the members of Diplomatic Service could have been considered as the officials of the State of Lithuania.
As a result of the dissolution of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs by the aggressors and their demand to close the diplomatic missions abroad, Lithuanian envoys in foreign countries declared protests against the occupation and annexation of Lithuania. The Soviets arrested and jailed diplomats in Kaunas, expropriated the property of those who have stayed abroad, and deprived them of their Lithuanian citizenship. On the eve of the occupation, the envoy in Rome Stasys Lozoraitis was appointed Chief of the Diplomatic Services of the Republic of Lithuania. He was the supreme legal official of Lithuania appointed by the legitimate Government. Later on, this position was also held by the envoys Jurgis Šaulys and Stasys Antanas Bačkis.
The United States of America and other Western countries adopted the Non-recognition policy regarding the Soviet occupation and annexation of the Baltic countries, allowing the Diplomatic Service to continue its activities and uninterruptedly represent the interests of Lithuania during the occupation.
The key concern of Chief of the Diplomat Service was to organize an effective functioning of diplomatic and consular service, to inform the free world on the situation in occupied Lithuania, on violent Soviet repressions and persecutions, and to convey the will of the people to recover the Independence. The Diplomatic Service also liaised with the associations of Lithuanian diaspora, supported the dissidents to the Soviet rule, and by means of radio waves spread the word of freedom to the inhabitants of occupied Lithuania. It succeeded in maintaining the buildings of Lithuanian legations in Washington (USA) and the Vatican; the tricolor national flag of Lithuania, banned in occupied Lithuania, was as well maintained there. The Diplomatic Service in exile was part of the common effort, the democratic forces against communist regimes and dictatorships. The activities of the Diplomatic Service in exile manifested uninterrupted sovereignty of the Republic of Lithuania and embodied the continuation of independence until the restoration of Independence in 1990.
The mission of diplomats in exile ‘to survive and come back’ was implemented in full, when on the 6th of September, 1991, Stasys Antanas Bačkis, the last Chief of the Diplomatic Services of Lithuania, delegated the authority to Algirdas Saudargas, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Lithuania.`,

            `During the Rebirth period, the activists of Sąjūdis (The Reform Movement) contacted the Diplomatic Service of the Republic of Lithuania in exile. The first diplomatic steps were made to establish relationships with public and state institutions of democratic countries, and Lithuanian Information Centers were established abroad.
        In the summer of 1991, Lithuania got international recognition and reestablished itself on the political world map. The same year, Lithuania became a member of the United Nations as well as the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE).Lithuania settled its relations with neighboring states by signing various treaties. The Treaty on the Foundations of Inter-State Relations between Lithuania and Russia was signed on the 29th of July 1991. Russian armed forces left Lithuanian territory in 1993. After lengthy negotiations, Lithuania and Poland on the 26th of April, 1994, signed the Treaty of Good Neighbourship and Friendly Cooperation. The Agreement on Baltic Parliamentary and Governmental Co-operation between Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia was signed in June, 1994, and and Lithuania and Belarus in 1995 signed the Treaty of Good Neighbourship and Friendly Cooperation.
The State needed to establish a modern and efficient Diplomatic Service in order to represent its international interests. People from various fields of science and culture, public figures, and Lithuanians abroad were invited to join the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The network of diplomatic missions expanded. The state borders of Lithuania were fixed for the first time. Embassies and consulates looked for new markets for Lithuanian manufacturers and established economic relations with many countries in Europe, North and South America, Asia, and Africa.
Lithuania's membership in the European Union and NATO in 2004 marked the moment of triumph for the nation and the beginning of an important geopolitical shift. Integration to Euro-Atlantic structures successfully allowed Lithuania to establish itself in the Western system, as well as to strengthen its socio-economic welfare and security. Other major achievements of the Diplomatic Service of the Republic of Lithuania were the Chairmanship of OSCE in 2011, the Presidency of the EU Council in the second half of 2013, and the non-permanent membership on the United Nations Security Council in 2014-2015.
In 2018, Lithuania was admitted to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).
Consistently defending common democratic values, the principles of humanity and peace in international relations, having established diplomatic relations with 186 countries, and having been represented by a network of over 50 diplomatic missions and over 200 honorary consuls, Lithuania has been a noteworthy, respected, and responsible partner: “The long night of fear, uncertainty and loneliness is over. You’re joining the strong and growing family of NATO. Our alliance has made a solid pledge of protection. And anyone who chose Lithuania as an enemy has also made an enemy of the United States of America.”
President George W. Bush delivered a speech at the Vilnius Town Hall Square, on November 22, 2002.`,
